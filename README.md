Twitch Morse Code Project

The .ino file is the Arduino project file whereas the TwitchChat Folder represents the Java aspect. 

To Run set up LED circuit on Arduino board going from Pin #9 to a resistor to a led back to ground. Then load the Arduino with the .ino file. After that execute the Chatstripper.jar file located in builds/libs/Chatstripper.jar by running "java -jar Chatstripper.jar". Once the jar is running and the board is connected with the proper .ino file, go to your twitch channel specified in the Chatstripper.jar and type a message.
